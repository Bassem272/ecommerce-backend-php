If you want to modify your GraphQL schema to allow for querying a single field from the `products` table, you can do so by adjusting the `fields` definition in your `ObjectType`. Here’s how to approach it:

### Adjusting the Query to Allow for Specific Fields

1. **Modify the Schema for the `products` Query:**
   You can add parameters to your `products` query to specify which fields you want to retrieve. However, GraphQL inherently supports fetching specific fields based on the request itself. You generally do not need to alter the schema to limit the fields returned; instead, you structure your GraphQL query to ask for only the fields you need.

2. **Example Queries:**
   - If you want to get all products with their `id`, `name`, and `price`, your GraphQL query would look like this:

   ```graphql
   {
       products {
           id
           name
           price
       }
   }
   ```

   - If you want to get only the `name` of the products, your query would be:

   ```graphql
   {
       products {
           name
       }
   }
   ```

### Updating the QueryType Definition

If you want to allow querying a specific product by its ID or another attribute, you can add a new field to the `QueryType`. Here’s how to do it:

```php
$queryType = new ObjectType([
    'name' => 'Query',
    'fields' => [
        'products' => [
            'type' => Type::listOf(new ObjectType([
                'name' => 'Product',
                'fields' => [
                    'id' => Type::int(),
                    'name' => Type::string(),
                    'price' => Type::float(),
                    'category_id' => Type::int(),
                ],
            ])),
            'args' => [
                'id' => ['type' => Type::int()],
                'name' => ['type' => Type::string()],
            ],
            'resolve' => function ($root, $args) use ($conn) {
                $sql = "SELECT * FROM products";
                
                // If an ID is provided, filter by it
                if (isset($args['id'])) {
                    $sql .= " WHERE id = " . (int)$args['id'];
                }
                
                // If a name is provided, filter by it
                if (isset($args['name'])) {
                    $sql .= " WHERE name = '" . $conn->real_escape_string($args['name']) . "'";
                }

                $result = $conn->query($sql);
                $products = [];

                while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
                    $products[] = new Product($row['id'], $row['name'], $row['price'], $row['category_id']);
                }
                return $products;
            },
        ],
        'categories' => [
            'type' => Type::listOf(new ObjectType([
                'name' => 'Category',
                'fields' => [
                    'id' => Type::int(),
                    'name' => Type::string(),
                ],
            ])),
            'resolve' => function ($root, $args) use ($conn) {
                $sql = "SELECT * FROM categories";
                $result = $conn->query($sql);
                $categories = [];

                while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
                    $categories[] = new Category($row['id'], $row['name']);
                }
                return $categories;
            },
        ],
    ],
]);
```

### Summary of Changes

- **Add `args`:** In the `products` field, I added `args` to accept an `id` and a `name`. This allows users to query for products based on specific criteria.
  
- **Update the `resolve` Function:** The `resolve` function is updated to construct the SQL query based on the provided arguments. It checks if an `id` or `name` is specified and filters the SQL accordingly.

### Example Queries with the New Setup

1. **To Get All Products:**

   ```graphql
   {
       products {
           id
           name
           price
       }
   }
   ```

2. **To Get a Specific Product by ID:**

   ```graphql
   {
       products(id: 1) {
           name
           price
       }
   }
   ```

3. **To Get Products by Name:**

   ```graphql
   {
       products(name: "Product A") {
           id
           price
       }
   }
   ```

### Conclusion

With this setup, you can now query your GraphQL API to get specific fields from the `products` table or filter the results based on the criteria you specify. This flexibility is one of the main advantages of using GraphQL, as clients can request exactly the data they need without over-fetching.
