To clarify the requirement: 

The requirement emphasizes that **differences between product types** (e.g., `ClothesProduct` vs `TechProduct`) and attribute types should be handled through **polymorphism** and **class inheritance**, rather than by using conditional logic like `if` or `switch` statements within the actual **models themselves** (the `Product` or `Attribute` classes).

### Key Points:
1. **Within Models**: You **cannot** use `if`/`switch` statements inside the `Product` or `Attribute` classes (or any other model class). Instead, you should leverage object-oriented principles, such as inheritance and polymorphism, to handle differences between product types. This ensures that each type is responsible for its own behavior, making the code more extensible and maintainable.
   
   Example of what is **not allowed** inside a model:
   ```php
   class Product {
       public function getAttributes() {
           if ($this->category_id == 2) {
               return $this->getClothesAttributes();
           } elseif ($this->category_id == 3) {
               return $this->getTechAttributes();
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   Instead, you would use separate classes for each product type, so no `if` or `switch` is needed inside the models.

2. **Factory or Other Logic**: Outside of the models, it **is permissible** to use a factory or some external logic that determines which class to instantiate, and this may involve `if` or `switch` statements to check the product type. However, this is typically done at a higher level, such as in a factory class or a resolver, which is responsible for delegating the creation of objects.

   Example of **permissible** use in a factory:
   ```php
   class ProductFactory {
       public static function createProduct($category_id, $productData) {
           if ($category_id == 2) {
               return new ClothesProduct($productData);
           } elseif ($category_id == 3) {
               return new TechProduct($productData);
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   In this example, the `ProductFactory` uses `if` statements to instantiate the appropriate product subclass, but the **models themselves** (e.g., `ClothesProduct`, `TechProduct`) do not use any conditional logic to handle differences between product types.

### Why This Distinction Matters:
- **In the models**: Using inheritance and polymorphism means that each type of product (or attribute) handles its own behavior. This keeps the logic simple and extendable as new product types can be added without changing existing code.
- **Outside the models**: Conditional logic in factories or higher-level code is acceptable because these are places where object creation or orchestration is done, rather than defining how the products behave.

### In Summary:
- **Permissible**: Use `if`/`switch` statements in **factories or higher-level orchestration logic** (like controllers or resolvers).
- **Not Permissible**: Use `if`/`switch` statements within **model classes** like `Product` or `Attribute` to handle differences between types.

This approach ensures that the differences between types are handled in a clean, object-oriented manner.
